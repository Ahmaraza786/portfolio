    description1: "Hello! My name is Ahmad Raza, a graduate from FAST University, Pakistan, with a degree in Computer Science obtained in 2024. I am an ambitious full-stack MERN developer, dedicated to building and optimizing interactive, user-friendly applications.",
    description2: "My journey into web development began at Fast University, where I honed my skills in full-stack web development. A pivotal project during my 4th semester in my bachelors, which involved analyzing movies with historical themes as educational tools, inadvertently steered me towards this career path. Although the website was a minor component of the project, the exhilaration of bringing it to life ignited my passion for web development. Beyond my professional interests, I am an avid bibliophile, cherishing not only the joy of reading but also the delight in curating and maintaining a personal library.",
